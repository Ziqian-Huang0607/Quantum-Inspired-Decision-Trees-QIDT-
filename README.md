# Quantum-Inspired Decision Trees (QIDT)

Quantum-Inspired Decision Trees (QIDT) is an innovative machine learning method that leverages principles from quantum computing to enhance traditional decision trees. This method introduces probabilistic splits inspired by quantum superposition, allowing for more nuanced and flexible decision boundaries.

## Features

- **Quantum-Inspired Splits**: Utilizes probabilistic splits inspired by quantum superposition.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Capable of modeling complex relationships without deep hierarchical structures.
- **Interpretability**: Maintains the interpretability of traditional decision trees while improving predictive power.

## Installation
